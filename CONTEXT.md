# CONTEXT.md

Domain vocabulary for the `m365-copilot-proxy` repo. Skills and issue tickets
name concepts with these terms. Do not drift to synonyms.

## What this repo is

An OpenAI-compatible **proxy** that wraps Microsoft 365 Copilot's undocumented
SignalR/WebSocket API. OpenAI-compatible coding agents (pi, Codex, standalone
bench) can use M365 as a model backend. It is a reverse-engineering project
against a live, undocumented, throttled API. It is not a normal SDK wrapper.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **M365** | Microsoft 365 Copilot (the undocumented chat backend). |
| **proxy** | This repo's OpenAI-compatible translation layer (`proxy-lib` + `proxy`). |
| **thread** | One M365 conversation. Throttle tracks threads-started, not messages. |
| **tone** | The model selector sent in the chat payload (`magic`, `*-quick`, reasoning tones). `magic` is default. |
| **Disengaged** | M365's refusal signal (`messageType: "Disengaged"`). Driven by jailbreak *shape*, not size. Often masquerades as throttle. Watch `usage.x_m365_dea_score`. |
| **fenced format** | Tool-call output as Markdown fences (```` ```bash ```` blocks). The only sanctioned tool format. |
| **shell-routing** | The proxy routes fenced bash blocks to the harness's shell tool. The load-bearing lever that produces real agent loops. |
| **fenced agent** | The Copilot Studio agent (`m365-tool-agent-<hash[:8]>`) that emits fenced tools. |
| **verifier** | The execution-intent verifier (`Bonsai` on the laptop, or `qwen`-family fallback) that decides `EXECUTE` vs `TEXT` for a tool decision. |
| **EXECUTE** | Verifier verdict: the tool call is authorized to run. |
| **TEXT** | Verifier verdict: return the model's raw text instead of executing. |
| **8H fail-closed** | The approved policy: only verifier `EXECUTE` authorizes tool execution. Anything else (TEXT/UNCERTAIN/error/timeout) resolves to raw text. |
| **optionsSets** | The server-side capability flags array in the chat payload. This repo historically sends `[]` — likely leaving capabilities off the table. |
| **benchtop** | The quantitative benchmark (`scripts/bench/`): scores real agentic coding tasks in `--network none` sandboxes. |

## Decisions

- **Native tool-calling is permanently OUT OF SCOPE.** MCP / a full Dataverse
  bot needs a Copilot Studio license, breaking the zero-cost premise. Tool
  calling stays prompt-emulated.
- **The draft 8H fail-closed policy is the approved safety baseline.** See
  `docs/adr/ADR-0002-EXECUTION-INTENT-VERIFIER.md` and
  `experiments/tool-decision/execution-intent/fail-closed-policy-8h.json`.
- **JSON `{"tool":...}` tool format is dead.** Fenced + shell-routing is the
  only tool format (scored 0/5, removed).
