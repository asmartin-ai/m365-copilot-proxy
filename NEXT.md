# NEXT.md — M365 Copilot Proxy
> Snapshot as of 2026-08-10.

**Start a new session here:** read
`docs/agents/working-methodology.md` (startup sequence + operating rules +
current mission), then `docs/agents/session-workflow.md` (operating manual),
then `CONTEXT.md` (vocabulary).

## Next session plan

1. **Auth into M365 on this PC** — human-assisted interactive login, per
   `docs/agents/m365-auth-workflow.md` (`bun run build` then
   `bun packages/proxy/bin/m365-login.mjs`, or start the proxy with
   `M365_ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_APPROVAL=1`). The PC currently has no
   `msal-cache.json` and no recorded login; telemetry is NOT evidence
   (test pollution, see the runbook).
2. **Verify auth** — `M365_DEBUG=1 bun scripts/proxy-verify.mjs --agent
   --multiturn` (real tool loop). Mind the thread budget (~12 new
   conversations/hour, ~600 msgs/conversation).
3. **Live tests** — attestation-gate end-to-end smoke (register →
   AUTHORIZED → tool result accepted) incl. the proof-header re-verification
   the laptop smoke predates; any framing/Disengaged checks from
   `docs/hypotheses.md` backlog.
4. **Implementation** — `.scratch/de-overengineering/issues/01-ponytail-
   cleanup-pass.md` item 6 (CdpClient → playwright) is now actionable once
   login works; triage `.scratch/review-triage/issues/01-review-findings.md`
   (AGENTS.md `bun test` correction, polluted-evidence cleanup decision).

**STE status:** All operational docs pass under pragmatic STE (2026-08-09).
The scientific notebooks (`docs/hypotheses.md`, `docs/experiments.md`,
`docs/overnight-log.md`) and the `.scratch/*` tickets and specs keep their
evidence verbatim. They are out of scope for this pass. The
writing-for-agents levers apply to AGENTS.md (2026-08-10).
`docs/agents/working-methodology.md` is the PC implementer startup playbook.

## Current baseline

- The **8H fail-closed verifier** remains the approved production baseline.
  Only an `EXECUTE` verdict can authorize execution. The default is on unless
  `M365_INTENT_VERIFIER=0`.
- Safety is proven on the frozen held-out corpus. Latency remains the
  architectural constraint.
- **Client-attested execution** is the chosen low-latency direction. It is
  opt-in (`M365_CLIENT_ATTESTATION=1` + request headers). It never replaces
  the 8H baseline. See `.scratch/client-attested-execution/spec.md` and
  tickets `01-attestation-gate.md` / `02-reference-adapters.md`.
- Use `git status -sb`, `git branch -vv`, and `git worktree list` for all
  current checkout, branch, and push state. Do not rely on this snapshot for
  volatile Git facts.

## Verifier-latency bake-off

- Ticket 01 rejected the Bonsai-27B thinking-off logprob scorer. Its
  tokenizer-aware variants produced unsafe false positives.
- Ticket 02 added the `chat_template_kwargs` contract to the verifier request.
- Ticket 03 screened direct-answer candidates on DEV only and closed
  **rejected**. Five candidates produced an unsafe false positive on
  `ambiguous-002`. Ministral-3-3B avoided unsafe output but failed selective
  accuracy. The existing Qwen3.5-4B evidence also fails accuracy.
- No candidate was frozen. Ticket 04, the one-time held-out gate, is
  ineligible and MUST NOT run.
- Evidence: `experiments/tool-decision/execution-intent/results/03-dev-screen/`,
  `docs/hypotheses.md` §§18–24, and
  `.scratch/verifier-latency-bakeoff/issues/`.

## Client-attested execution (opt-in, in progress)

The chosen direction solves the latency problem. The trusted local harness
(pi / OMP / Codex) attests one exact command before the proxy can execute it.
This replaces a slower local model making the same decision. The 8H baseline
stays the default. This path is explicitly opt-in.

- **Gate**: `POST /v1/attestations` (loopback-only). Payload:
  `{client, tool, tool_call_id, command_sha256, ts, nonce}`. Signature header
  `X-M365-Attestation-Sig` = HMAC-SHA256 over the payload lines. Single use,
  60 s expiry, registry caps at 1000 entries with rolling prune of
  expired/terminal candidates.
- **Enablers**: `M365_CLIENT_ATTESTATION=1` + shared `M365_ATTESTATION_SECRET`.
  Request headers `X-M365-Execution-Gate: attestation-v1`,
  `X-M365-Attestation-Client: pi|omp|codex`, AND
  `X-M365-Attestation-Proof: HMAC(secret, "attestation-v1\n"+client)` hex
  (generate with `bun client-adapters/attestation-helper.mjs --proof <client>`).
  Without proof the gate headers are ignored and the request stays on the 8H
  path. Adapter helper additionally needs
  `M365_ATTESTATION_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port>`.
- **Adapters**: `client-adapters/` — `pi-attestation-gate.ts`,
  `omp-attestation-gate.ts`, `codex-hooks.json` (PreToolUse approve|block),
  `attestation-helper.mjs` (+ `--proof` CLI).
- **Implementation state**: tickets 01 (gate) and 02 (adapters) resolved,
  unit-tested. Committed on `main` and merged to the laptop. Adversarial
  review 2026-08-09 found no blockers; fixed two SHOULD-FIXes:
  proof-of-secret required to strip 8H (bare headers no longer opt in), and
  tool results with never-emitted ids are denied 409 (fail closed; pool-emitted
  8H ids still pass). Two-pass validation so a 409 does not burn earlier
  candidates.
- **Documentation**: the full wire contract (payload, HMAC construction, state
  machine, failure modes, worked example) is in `docs/m365-copilot-api.md` §11
  *Client-attested execution (opt-in)*. Adapter setup lives in
  `client-adapters/README.md` (cross-referenced, not duplicated).
- **Next**: manual end-to-end smoke test of the attestation loop (register →
  AUTHORIZED → tool result accepted) through a real harness. The PC is
  auth-blocked (no `msal-cache.json`, no recorded login; the telemetry that
  looked like live traffic is unit-test pollution — traced 2026-08-10,
  see `docs/agents/m365-auth-workflow.md`). A human must complete the
  interactive login to unblock live steps on the PC. The laptop live-smoke
  passed 2026-08-09 before the proof-header change — the proof header must
  be re-verified live when the laptop is next available.

## New surface — `/v1/images/generations` (2026-08-09)

- OpenAI-compatible image generation backed by M365's GraphicArt path.
  `handleImageGeneration` in proxy-lib + Nitro route.
- Schema: prompt (trimmed, required), n (1–4, >4 rejected), size
  (gpt-image-1 set incl `auto`), response_format url|b64_json.
- Sized through the pool scheduler (`newConversation: true` per image) so
  image requests cannot exhaust the M365 thread budget; 503+Retry-After when
  saturated.
- Error map: quota 429, capacity/content 400, no_image 400, abort 499,
  missing url/base64 500, other 502.
- Adversarial review findings fixed: dead client-abort wiring (ServerResponse
  `close` only; same fix applied to the chat route), silent n-cap → schema
  rejection, whitespace prompts trimmed.
- Test count 287 passed / 3 skipped (was 254 at session start).

## Next slice

1. Select a genuinely different latency direction. It MUST retain the frozen
   fail-closed contract and the DEV gate order: zero unsafe false positives,
   selective accuracy at least 0.95, then latency.
2. Do not retry rejected candidates on held-out. Screen any new candidate on
   the 28-case DEV corpus first. Freeze one survivor before the single
   32-case held-out run.
3. Review the broader laptop-preparation history on the LAN remote before
   merging it into the PC branch or pushing it to GitHub. It includes work
   outside the bake-off evidence.
4. M365 live probes, including the custom-instructions probe, remain
   standby-only. They need explicit user authorization. Keep all M365 work
   sequential and thread-conserving.

## Laptop / pane recovery runbook (2026-08-09, collab relay outage)

The pane agents lost their collab link when the relay host died. Their
detached work (conversation pruner, `prune-results.json`) continued on the
laptop. When the panes reconnect:

1. Laptop (w8:p6): report pruner outcome — `prune-results.json` content,
   remaining session-store entries, port 1234 free, no stray chromium.
2. Laptop: `git fetch origin sync/attestation-2026-08-09 && git merge
   --no-edit origin/sync/attestation-2026-08-09` — pulls 10 commits:
   attestation gate + adapters, images route, proof-header security fix,
   telemetry fixes, STE docs, cramt digest, NEXT.md. Preserve laptop-local
   edits (hypotheses.md, logprob ticket, lightweight spec, laptop AGENTS.md).
3. Laptop: re-verify attestation LIVE with the new proof header —
   `X-M365-Attestation-Proof` is now REQUIRED to opt into the gate. Positive
   (register → allow → result accepted) and negative (no proof → 8H stays on;
   fabricated id → 409) paths. Budget: 12 threads/hr cap, ≥3 min spacing,
   hard stop at first empty-503/at-limit.
4. PC (w8:p1): nothing pending — all work committed and pushed to the sync
   branch. STE pass done (cramt-derived docs excluded per user override).
5. LAN quarantine still in force: do NOT push to `lan/main` or GitHub until
   `review/laptop-preparation` + `review/lan-bakeoff-disposition` are reviewed,
   then secret scan + pre-push hook.

## Standing verification and safety

- Preserve the frozen prompt, corpus, gold labels, policy, and split
  validator. Run `experiments/tool-decision/execution-intent/validate-split.mjs`
  before any new screen.
- Every local-model response MUST identity-guard the echoed model. Screen
  models one local server at a time. Keep GGUF weights and local hash manifests
  out of Git.
- Normal code verification: `bun run build`, `bun test`, and the applicable
  package typecheck. Live M365 verification uses quota and needs explicit
  approval.
- The repository is public. Run the secret scan and preserve the pre-push
  hook at each egress point.
