# NEXT.md — M365 Copilot Proxy
> Snapshot as of 2026-08-09.

## Current baseline

- The **8H fail-closed verifier** remains the approved production baseline.
  Only an `EXECUTE` verdict may authorize execution. The default is on unless
  `M365_INTENT_VERIFIER=0`.
- Safety is proven on the frozen held-out corpus. Latency remains the
  architectural constraint.
- **Client-attested execution** is the chosen low-latency direction: opt-in
  (`M365_CLIENT_ATTESTATION=1` + request headers), never replaces the 8H
  baseline. See `.scratch/client-attested-execution/spec.md` and tickets
  `01-attestation-gate.md` / `02-reference-adapters.md`.
- Use `git status -sb`, `git branch -vv`, and `git worktree list` for all
  current checkout, branch, and push state. Do not rely on this snapshot for
  volatile Git facts.

## Verifier-latency bake-off

- Ticket 01 rejected the Bonsai-27B thinking-off logprob scorer. Its
  tokenizer-aware variants produced unsafe false positives.
- Ticket 02 added the `chat_template_kwargs` contract to the verifier request.
- Ticket 03 screened direct-answer candidates on DEV only and closed
  **rejected**. Five candidates produced an unsafe false positive on
  `ambiguous-002`; Ministral-3-3B avoided unsafe output but failed selective
  accuracy. The existing Qwen3.5-4B evidence also fails accuracy.
- No candidate was frozen. Ticket 04, the one-time held-out gate, is
  ineligible and MUST NOT run.
- Evidence: `experiments/tool-decision/execution-intent/results/03-dev-screen/`,
  `docs/hypotheses.md` §§18–24, and
  `.scratch/verifier-latency-bakeoff/issues/`.

## Client-attested execution (opt-in, in progress)

The chosen direction for the latency problem: instead of a slower local model
making the same decision, the trusted local harness (pi / OMP / Codex) attests
one exact command before the proxy may execute it. The 8H baseline stays the
default; this path is explicitly opt-in.

- **Gate**: `POST /v1/attestations` (loopback-only). Payload:
  `{client, tool, tool_call_id, command_sha256, ts, nonce}`; signature header
  `X-M365-Attestation-Sig` = HMAC-SHA256 over the payload lines. Single use,
  60 s expiry, registry caps at 1000 entries.
- **Enablers**: `M365_CLIENT_ATTESTATION=1` + shared `M365_ATTESTATION_SECRET`.
  Request headers `X-M365-Execution-Gate: attestation-v1` and
  `X-M365-Attestation-Client: pi|omp|codex`. Adapter helper additionally needs
  `M365_ATTESTATION_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port>`.
- **Adapters**: `client-adapters/` — `pi-attestation-gate.ts`,
  `omp-attestation-gate.ts`, `codex-hooks.json` (PreToolUse approve|block),
  `attestation-helper.mjs`.
- **Implementation state**: tickets 01 (gate) and 02 (adapters) resolved,
  unit-tested. **Uncommitted** — do not commit until the LAN branch review
  (below) clears, then one local commit, then merge/push only after secret
  scan + pre-push hook.
- **Next**: manual end-to-end smoke test of the attestation loop (register →
  AUTHORIZED → tool result accepted) through a real harness; document the
  handshake in `docs/m365-copilot-api.md` or a new doc once verified.

## Next slice

1. Select a genuinely different latency direction. It MUST retain the frozen
   fail-closed contract and the DEV gate order: zero unsafe false positives,
   selective accuracy at least 0.95, then latency.
2. Do not retry rejected candidates on held-out. Screen any new candidate on
   the 28-case DEV corpus first. Freeze one survivor before the single
   32-case held-out run.
3. Review the broader laptop-preparation history on the LAN remote before
   merging it into the PC branch or pushing it to GitHub. It includes work
   outside the bake-off evidence.
4. M365 live probes, including the custom-instructions probe, remain
   standby-only. They need explicit user authorization. Keep all M365 work
   sequential and thread-conserving.

## Standing verification and safety

- Preserve the frozen prompt, corpus, gold labels, policy, and split
  validator. Run `experiments/tool-decision/execution-intent/validate-split.mjs`
  before any new screen.
- Every local-model response MUST identity-guard the echoed model. Screen
  models one local server at a time. Keep GGUF weights and local hash manifests
  out of Git.
- Normal code verification: `bun run build`, `bun test`, and the applicable
  package typecheck. Live M365 verification uses quota and needs explicit
  approval.
- The repository is public. Run the secret scan and preserve the pre-push
  hook at each egress point.
